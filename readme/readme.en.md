Accomdemy 伴伴學 is a self-learning organization originally formed by a group of partners from a science, technology, start-up, and education background.

**Accomdemy = Accompany + Academy.**

We hope that through the online sharing session based on the Companion Learning model, everyone who wants to learn on their own will step on a journey that is fun and not alone!

Good learning resources have always been unevenly distributed but the competition for these resources is only getting increasingly intense. Maybe some people want to learn but have no way to get started; maybe some people want to learn, but the financial situation does not permit it; maybe some people want to learn, but feel lonely on their learning journey. These situations will not get better by themselves, so we set up [Accomdemy 伴伴學].

We believe that education and technology can help people break through their self-limitations and make the world a better place, and we believe that the best learning method comes from motivated and autonomous learning, so we call on partners with the same beliefs to contribute their strengths together. Let those who want to learn but have no way to get started enjoy the fun of learning, let them have the guidance of an experienced mentor instantly to make their learning journey fun and not alone.
